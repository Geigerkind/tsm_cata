# TSM 2.8 for cata 4.3.4 with handy macros and profiles
This version contains a few extra functionalities that I added but commented out, in order to not destroy the economy, find it if you want ;)

## How do you make big profit with glyphs?
1. Roll on a fresh server
2. Make a bunch of inscription characters to have as many CDs as possible
3. Have an AH account to camp the AH 24/7
4. Buy your AH account the 32 inscription bags
5. Stock your AH account with every useful research glyph that you have
6. Get all possible glyphs through Book of Glyphmastery as fast as possible, BoGM prices dont matter!
7. Put the following macros below on your mousewheel
8. Have a second monitor where you can constantly monitor if you had been undercut
9. If undercut, go over with your mouse and scroll your wheel
10. Get banned, because you seem like a bot
11. PROFIT?!
